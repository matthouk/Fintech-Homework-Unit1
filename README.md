* How did the idea for the company come about? 
    * Mr. Gabbery realized a gap in the industry and wanted to fill that gap. The company he worked for at the time, did not see the benefits of filling the gap, and so Mr. Gabbert left and founded his own company.

    * Total: 13.8M
    * Brock Mansfield also provided funds in Series A.

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
    * Pitchbook was founded and runs as the premier data and research provider for M&A, Private Equity and VC's in the Finance Industry. Prior to its founding, there was not a great database that would provide this information. 
* Who is the company's intended customer? What is the market size of this set of customers? 
    * Their  data applies to anyone interested. Primarily VC’s PE firms. VC, PE, Corp, I-Bank, Advisory, and Lenders. 
    * According to the write up for their 2020 CODiE award, more than 40,000 investment professionals use the service but the number of core professionals that would benefit numbered over 1.05 million as of 2019. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
    * This is the first major research firm that provides data in the PE data market. They capitalized on a missing market for this sort of data and become one of the biggest providers of it. 
    * The company has expanded their footprint to not just providing a desktop application, they now incorporate multiple interfaces as well as other services including in the one subscription cost. Some of those services/interfaces:

        + NER, Named Entity Recognition
            - They implement this with their more than 650,000 webcrawlers to analyze google trends and the web to indentify targeted information for their users.

    * Now more than ever, the amount of data that a research company can find on specific people, markets, or the world can be used in association with vast CPU power like AI and ML to help make better decisions. The Finance Market has always been about gathering as much data as possible to make the best decision based on events that have happened, or more importantly, _will happen_. This company is on the cutting edge of compiling and providing that information.

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * This company has been a game changer for private equity information. 
    * Some of the biggest players in Finance utilize PitchBook 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Some metrics include profits, customer reviews, NPS 
    * The company fairs pretty well by all standards. Most notably, the initial investor acquired the company due to it peforming so well. 
    * Reviews for the company and NPS tends to trend 7-9/10 on most reviews sites I could find. Their biggest performance attritbute is their core service, providing private market financial information. 
    * The most common drawbacks, or issues that affect their reviews related to technical difficulties with some of their other services (excel plugin, chrome extension), and that some data in other sectors can be slow to load or be updated. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Pitchbook fairs better in the Private Market research than some rival companies based on reviews. However, some rival firms have different sets of data and tools that can provide more information and different routes to access data. 
    * One notable drawback for many PitchBook users is that the service is great for finding funds and investors. However, there is not often a long term use case for keepind a PitchBook subscription. 

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
    * My recommendation for this company has two parts. 
        + First, I would double down on the compentent aspects of their research. Ramping up the data provider by their research team, and ensure that their recurring data stays up to date. (i.e. ensuring that PNL statements are updated as soon as released. This should be simple using automation.) as this was a review 
        + Second, I would have the company expand their footprint in the reserach they provide. They have established themselves as a Private Markets data firm, but could use the tools and teams they have to expand to all equities and beyond. This would keep them relevant for firms and investors beyond their initial search for funds. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * Going back to the reviews, this company has a limited use-case for a lot of the clients that use it. Let's say a new startup is looking for funds and wants to use PitchBook to make their pitch. Once they fund their startup, Pitchbook is no longer a viable subscription. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * As it stands, I would recommend they expand the research they already provide but it would not require new technology or services.
